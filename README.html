<h2>Usage:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go to Facebook and starts the game. Wait until it loads and shows the main menu.</li>
<li>Select "English" language and set animation quality to "low" (the small icon on the left top corner). This is to make the game faster and smoother.</li>
<li>Launch the bot.</li>
<li>Set out the windows as desired. It is not mandatory to leave the bot windows visible, but it's advisable. 
Warning: the game window must NOT be ocludded by any other window.</li>
<li>Press "Start", then "World tour". The bot will do the rest until finish one game.</li>
</ul>

At any time you can close the bot by pressing ESC or closing its window, but in that case the so far learned data will not be saved.

<h2>About the directories:</h2>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><code>learndata</code>: 
Here it is saved all the bot learns. This directory is NOT included in the downloads, so the bot will fail a lot the first time you run it, then eventually it will learn and improve.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><code>tessdata</code>: Files used by <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/">tessract</a>, the OCR engine.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><code>data</code>: Images needed by the program.</li>
</ul>
